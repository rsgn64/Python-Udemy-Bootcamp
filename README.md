# 2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python

<h2>Overview:</h2>

The course: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/

This repository contains all the milestone projects for this course. The course does not cover Git or GitHub so this is also a learning experience for it.

<h3><u>Milestone One: Tic-Tac-Toe</u></h3>

First Python program in over 15 years. It's horrible and inefficient, but I did not watch any of the "getting started" lecture content, I simply dove-in.

There's too many lines and probably way better ways to do it (have not watched solution at time of writing). Instead of 2 players at same computer I simply made the computer choose randomly; perhaps I can revisit some day with AI, but I'd probably laugh at myself and re-do it.

<h3><u>Milestone Two: Blackjack</u></h3>

This milestone applied OOP via a simple blackjack game. It was a great refresher on the thought process that must go into structuring your program and setting everything up. Again, it could definitely use work, however the main teachings have been applied which was enough for me to be confident that I've understood the course content.

<h3><u>Milestone Three: Crash Course Downloader</u></h3>

Milestone three was the Final Capstone Project where we were given a list of potential projects to practice on. Initially, I completed some of the simple number based ones in Jupyter Notebook, but didn't bother to save them. Then I decided to find a personal problem to solve and remembered I wanted to have all the practical Crash Course videos for offine viewing. Therefore, I wrote this simple program using the latter concepts of the course to do just that. It's as simple as it seems: the script web-scrapes to find the download links I told it to and downloads & organizes/renames the files for me.
