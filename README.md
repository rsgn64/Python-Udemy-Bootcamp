# Python-VSCode (Udemy Bootcamp)

<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe:</h3>

First Python program in over 15 years. It's horrible and inefficient, but I did not watch any of the "getting started" lecture content, I simply dove-in.

There's too many lines and probably way better ways to do it (have not watched solution at time of writing). Instead of 2 players at same computer I simply made the computer choose randomly; perhaps I can revisit some day with AI.
