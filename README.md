<h2>Overview:</h2>

This repository contains all the milestone projects for this course. The course does not cover Git or GitHub so this is also a learning experience for it.

<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe:</h3>

First Python program in over 15 years. It's horrible and inefficient, but I did not watch any of the "getting started" lecture content, I simply dove-in.

There's too many lines and probably way better ways to do it (have not watched solution at time of writing). Instead of 2 players at same computer I simply made the computer choose randomly; perhaps I can revisit some day with AI, but I'd probably laugh at myself and re-do it.
